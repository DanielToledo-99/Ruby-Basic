# Say Hello

This program should ask the user for they name and print a hello message back,
otherwise, it prints a sad message.

In this example the user inputs "Diego"

```bash
$ ruby say_hello.rb
Whats your name?
Diego
Hello Diego! Welcome to the Ruby module.
$
```

In this example, the user inputs nothing (only hits enter)

```bash
$ ruby say_hello.rb
Whats your name?

No one to say hello to. :cry:
$ 
```

Modify the file `say_hello.rb` to meet the requirements.

## Tests

To run the test, make sure you are in `/01say_hello` directory and execute
`ruby say_hello_test.rb`

If everything is ok you will get back something like this where each dot (.)
after "Running:" represents a passing test. In this case, 2 passing tests = 2
dots (..) 🎉

```bash
$ ruby say_hello_test.rb
Run options: --seed 45484

# Running:

..

Finished in 0.001027s, 1947.4203 runs/s, 1947.4203 assertions/s.
2 runs, 2 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips
```

If something went wrong you will see the error message with the failing test and
the detail of what was expected and what was received.

```bash
ruby say_hello/say_hello_test.rb
Run options: --seed 8500

# Running:

In the example above the test input `"Diego"` and the expected response was
`"Hello Diego! Welcome to the Ruby module."` but instead it receive
`"Hola Diego! Bienvenido al modulo de Ruby."`. So my mistake was that I wrote
the response in Spanish instead of English 😅

When you get an error, analyze carefully the `expected` value and the `actual`
your program is generating. Go back to your code and pay attention to the
details. Surely you will figure it out! 💪🏼 If you get stuck, as for help in
